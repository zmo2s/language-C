Node *copy(Node *list) {

  Node *newlist, *p, *prev;

  newlist = p = NULL;

  while (list != NULL) {
      p = malloc(sizeof(*p));
      strcpy(p->airport, list->airport);
      if (!newlist)
          newlist = p;
      else
          prev->next = p;
      prev = p;
      list = list->next;
  }
  prev->next = NULL;
  return newlist;
}
You need to keep a reference to the previous node to update its next in the next iteration.
